You can actually use Avant's personal loans for just about anything, except for illegal activities or paying for a college education. Avant advertises some of the most common personal loan uses on its website, but keep in mind these aren't actually different loans, since they all have the same terms and conditions:

Home improvement loans to fix or upgrade your living space, inside and out
Debt consolidation loans to combine multiple higher-interest debts into one loan
Emergency loans to pay for surprise expenses like medical treatments or car repairs
