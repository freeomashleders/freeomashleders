Quick funding timelines: There are lenders with faster service available than Avant, but not by much: If you're approved for a loan by 4:30 p.m. Central Time, Monday through Friday, Avant will typically send you the money via ACH the following day.
Lower credit requirements than most lenders: Avant will approve loans for people with credit scores as low as 580, assuming you meet other requirements. Most other lenders will just deny you outright if your credit score is that low.
Lower income requirements than most lenders: As long as you bring in at least $1,200 in income per month, you may be eligible for a loan. Given that that's close to the median weekly take-home pay for Americans, that means many people stand a chance of approval when other lenders might pass on them.
