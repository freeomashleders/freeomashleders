Change due date: Youâ€™ll be able to change your monthly payment due date to make it more convenient.
Highly rated mobile app: Avant offers Apple and Google Play apps, both of which come highly rated. You can't use the app to apply for a personal loan, but once you have one, you can use it to manage just about every aspect of your repayment. 
Light on perks: Lenders catering to a higher-credit-profile crowd generally offer more features, like paying your creditors directly for debt consolidation, unemployment protection, or even the ability to skip a payment every so often. In comparison, Avant doesn't offer very many extra benefits.
